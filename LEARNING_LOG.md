### css
1. css alignments:
 theres two important alignments overall. 
  - flexbox 
  - grid alignment.

1. *flexbox*:

**flexbox** is used in one-dimentional layouts. to align items in a line wether thats a column or a row meaning only one axis allowed. 
**flexbox** is used to align elements like in a navbar or similar cases.

- elements:

1. `flex-direction: row/column;` 
by default its set to row. this property defines the main axis.

2. `justify-content: flex start;`
align items on the main axis

3. ` align-items: center;` 
align items on the cross axis

4. `flex-wrap: wrap/nowrap;` 
by default nowrap: means the content will try to fit into one line. meanwhile, wrap would allow the content to take as much lines as needed.
 - `align-content: ;`
aligns everything on the cross axis. only used when we use wrap

5. ` gap: 11px;`
decides the space between the elements.




grid is more complex, two dimentional

side note:
box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;
